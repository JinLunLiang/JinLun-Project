## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects and briefly describing the projetc and technology stack used.

### Shopping_Trends & Segmentation Analysis

**Project:** [`Shopping_Trends & Segmentation_Analysis.sql`](https://github.com/JinLunLiang/JinLun-Project/blob/main/Shopping_Trends%20%26%20Segmentation_Analysis.sql)

**Description:** The dataset comprises customer demographic information and also customer purchase behavior and trends. This project utilizes SQL to analyze the shopping trends dataset, focusing on customer behavior and segmentation. By analyzing shopping trends and customer behavior, we are able to understand customer dynamics and their impact on business strategies.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, CTE's, Windows Functions, Rank Functions, Aggregate Functions, Case Expressions, Data Visualization in Tableau

**Technology:** SQL Server, Tableau

### Walmart Sales

**Project:** [`Walmart_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/JinLunLiang/JinLun-Project/blob/main/Walmart_Sales_Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains weekly sales figures, along with other economic and environmental factors such as Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI (Consumer Price Index), and Unemployment. By examining these relationships, we aim to understand how external factors might influence weekly sales performance. We also uncover holiday and non-holiday impacts on sales performance and identify overall patterns in weekly average sales over time.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Aggregation and Grouping, Data Visualization Using Matplotlib & Seaborn

**Technology:** Python - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
